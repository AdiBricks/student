# Week 11 Plan
 - Finish work About Page.
    - Create an About page with an engaging backstory for viewers.
    - Set up the HTML structure with distinct div elements having the class "parallax."
    - Define CSS styles for these elements to create a full viewport height background with a fixed attachment.
    - Apply a simple trans-white box for text boxes to stand out against the background, giving a modern touch.
    - Use the getBoundingClientRect() method to track the scroll position and change the background when the viewer reaches a certain point while scrolling.
    - Ensure the effect creates an enjoyable parallax effect for viewers.
    - Ask team about switching out the pictures! 
- Finish out review ticket for the week
