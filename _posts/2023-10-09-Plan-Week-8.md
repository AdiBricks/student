# Week 8 Plan
- Finish HW for Iteration and Boolean If
- Split roles for the Project
- Finish work on 360 Viewer.
- Create a 360 viewing garage to provide visitors with an immersive experience of viewing the cars available for rental.
    - Reach out to art or elective classes to acquire car models.
    - Use Blender, a 3D animation tool, to create a car garage with the obtained models in an equirectangular format.
    - Implement the 360 viewer into the website.
    - Attempt different methods to integrate the 3D viewer directly, but encountered time constraints.
    - Opt for an external 360 viewer website and link it to provide visitors with the immersive experience.
